    <h3>Acceptable Proof of Firearms Training</h3>
    <p>
      Acceptable proof of firearms training can include a CCW permit, DD-214, Hunter Education card, a certificate from a competition, certificate of completion from an NRA course, etc. 
    <p>
      If you don’t have firearms training of any kind, the club periodically offers a fairly short “home firearm safety” certification course in our clubhouse out by the softball fields (map below). If you want to take a more thorough training course, the club offers training to get your Hunter’s Education card and it offers a couple of NRA certification courses, but both of those are multiple day endeavors. Dates for these are listed on the Events Calendar.
